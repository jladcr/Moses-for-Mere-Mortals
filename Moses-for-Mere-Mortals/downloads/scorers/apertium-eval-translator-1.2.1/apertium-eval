# This script approximates the word error rate (WER) between
# a translation
# performed by the apertium MT system and a reference translation
# obtained by post-editing the system output; it also uses the original
# text to compute the coverage of the system's dictionaries.
# 
# It "approximates" because it uses "diff -d", which is an approximation
# to the real edit distance.
