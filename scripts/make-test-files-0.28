# PURPOSE: 
#=========
# Given 2 strictly aligned files, one in the source language and another in the target language, this script creates a backup of them and cuts each of them into 3 parts: one that will be used for training, another for testing the training and still another for tuning. The initial files are divided into X sectors (defined by the user in the settings of this script) and the script extracts Y pseudorandom segments from each sector (the value Y is also defined by the user). This script can be used to create training test files that attempt to cover the whole universe of the sampling space and which simultaneously sample pseudorandomly each of those sectors Y times in an attempt to get a test file that is more representative of that universe than a list of X*Y consecutive segments would be. The files used for training will have those segments erased. The initial corpus will be preserved (the files that will be used for corpus training are new files created by this script).

#  PRE-REQUIREMENTS:
#===================
# 1) A Moses installation must have been made with the create-* script;
