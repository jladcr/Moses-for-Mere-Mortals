# PURPOSE: 
#=========
# Creates a copy of your trained corpora that can be used by someone else (even if in another computer) or by yourself in a different Moses installation (you can have more than one Moses installation in the same computer). Your $mosesdir is written literally (e.g., "/home/john") in several trained corpora files. You have to change that string so that it reflects the $mosesdir to which you want to transfer your trainings. This script locates your $mosesdir string in your trained corpora files and substitutes it by the equivalent $mosesdir string that defines the location where you want your trainings transferred to. It creates a $mosesdir/corpora_trained_for_another_location/newusername directory, within which it will create the corpora_trained and logs directory prepared for the other user/Moses installation. Takes a good while to run if you have trained very large corpora.

#  PRE-REQUIREMENTS:
#===================
# 1. The install-* script must have been run
# 2. Moses for Mere Mortals must have been created with the create-* script
# 3. The train-* script must have been run
